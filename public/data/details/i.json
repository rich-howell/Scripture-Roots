This is the common name given to Jacob's descendants. The whole people of the twelve tribes are called \"Israelites,\" the \"children of Israel\" ( Joshua 3:17 ; 7:25 ; Judges 8:27 ; Jeremiah 3:21 ), and the \"house of Israel\" ( Exodus 16:31 ; 40:38 ). This name Israel is sometimes used emphatically for the true Israel ( Psalms 73:1 : Isaiah 45:17 ; 49:3 ; John 1:47 ; Romans 9:6 ; 11:26 ).","scriptures":["Genesis 25:26","Genesis 25:27","Genesis 25:28","Genesis 25:29","Genesis 25:30","Genesis 25:31"],"spouses":["Bilhah","Leah","Rachel","Zilpah"],"parents":["Isaac","Rebekah"],"children":["Gad","Dan","Levi","Benjamin","Issachar","Reuben","Dinah","Asher","Zebulun","Simeon","Judah","Joseph","Naphtali"],"firstMention":"Genesis","birthYear":-1853,"deathYear":96,"verseCount":1009},"issachar_645":{"id":"issachar_645","name":"Issachar (sons of Leah: Reuben)","role":"Issachar","bio":"Hired ([Gen. 30:18](/gen#Gen.30.18)). \u201cGod hath given me,\u201d said Leah, \u201cmy hire (Heb.","scriptures":["Genesis 30:18","Genesis 35:23","Genesis 46:13","Genesis 49:14","Exodus 1:3","Numbers 1:8"],"spouses":[],"parents":["Israel","Leah"],"children":["Shimron","Tola","Jashub","Puah"],"firstMention":"Genesis","birthYear":-1752,"deathYear":96,"verseCount":38},"issachar_646":{"id":"issachar_646","name":"Issachar (Jacob's ninth son)","role":"Issachar","bio":null,"scriptures":["1 Chronicles 26:5"],"spouses":[],"parents":["Shimei"],"children":[],"firstMention":"1 Chronicles","birthYear":-1015,"deathYear":-1015,"verseCount":1},"isshiah_901":{"id":"isshiah_901","name":"Isshiah","role":"Isshiah","bio":null,"scriptures":["1 Chronicles 23:20","1 Chronicles 24:25"],"spouses":[],"parents":["Uzziel"],"children":["Zechariah"],"firstMention":"1 Chronicles","birthYear":-1015,"deathYear":-1015,"verseCount":2},"isuah_640":{"id":"isuah_640","name":"Isuah","role":"Isuah","bio":null,"scriptures":["Genesis 46:17","1 Chronicles 7:30"],"spouses":[],"parents":["Asher"],"children":[],"firstMention":"Genesis","birthYear":-1706,"deathYear":-1706,"verseCount":2},"isui_648":{"id":"isui_648","name":"Isui","role":"Isui","bio":null,"scriptures":["Genesis 46:17","Numbers 26:44","1 Chronicles 7:30"],"spouses":[],"parents":["Asher"],"children":[],"firstMention":"Genesis","birthYear":-1706,"deathYear":-1452,"verseCount":3},"ithamar_649":{"id":"ithamar_649","name":"Ithamar","role":"Ithamar","bio":"Palm isle, the fourth and youngest son of Aaron ([1 Chr. 6:3](/1chr#1Chr.6.3)).
